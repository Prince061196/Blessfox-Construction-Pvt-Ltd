            <p>Since our founding in 2024, we have steadily grown from servicing individual clients to working with large corporates. We started with small projects and, through the quality of our services, gained trust from big clients and became involved in major projects.</p>

                    <div class="year-badge">2024</div>
                    <br>
                    <p>We started off by offering our services to individual clients. We were involved in small to medium projects. During this phase we gained vast experience in the construction industry. We completed borehole installation projects, plumbing projects, plastering, solar geysers installations, building projects, and skimming projects.</p>

                    <p>We started the year at a higher notch, gaining large clients who trusted our brand. We were involved in the construction of major projects such as Madokero Creek Block 7, plastering of Madokero Creek Block 8, and plastering of Madokero Creek Block 6. We were also involved in demolishing concrete pillars for Mashonaland Tobacco company. The journey continues.</p>
